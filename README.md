### [Hackathon Winner](https://devpost.com/software/myanimebutler?ref_content=my-projects-tab&ref_feature=my_projects)
- Anime Recommendation Engine
- Implemented a [clustering algorithm](https://github.com/arjun-krishna1/MyAnimeButler/blob/main/cluster.py) inspired by the machine learning k-means clustering algorithm within a weekend in Python
- Created an [anime ranking algorithm](https://github.com/arjun-krishna1/MyAnimeButler/blob/main/cluster.py) using Python by interfacing with web application backend and anime clustering algorithm
- Reduced input data by 99.85% to machine learning algorithm by [analyzing database and extracting data](https://github.com/arjun-krishna1/MyAnimeButler/blob/main/data-cleaning-prep.ipynb) that will improve algorithmâ€™s performance the most while minimizing training and inference time.
